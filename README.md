# üåü Introduction

Welcome to the Neutron TimeCube (NTC) analysis tools repository! Here, you will find a suite of powerful MATLAB-based tools designed for the analysis and visualization of neutron data collected with the TimeCube detector. Whether you're a researcher, student, or data enthusiast, this repository is crafted to assist you in delving into neutron experiments with ease and precision.

# üìú Description

The [NTC analysis tools repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ntc) is your gateway to Neutron TimeCube analysis. This repository, created and maintained by Ultralytics, includes a collection of MATLAB scripts and functions specifically tailored for manipulating and interpreting neutron detection data. It's built to provide a user-friendly interface for data exploration and analysis, making it an invaluable resource for anyone involved in neutron research. 

# üì¶ Requirements

To ensure a seamless experience with the NTC analysis tools, you will need the following prerequisites:

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or newer. MATLAB is an interactive, interpretive language and environment used for statistical analysis, matrix computations, signal processing, and many other data-intensive tasks.
- Access to a common functions repository from Ultralytics: Clone it using the command `$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab`. Once cloned, add it to your MATLAB path with the command: 
```matlab
>> addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
```
- Essential MATLAB Toolboxes:
    - `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`: Provides functions and apps to describe, analyze, and model data using statistics and machine learning algorithms.
    - `Signal Processing Toolbox`: Offers a comprehensive set of reference-standard algorithms and tools for analog and digital signal processing (DSP) applications.

# üöÄ Running the Analysis Tool

To launch the NTC viewer from within MATLAB, simply enter the following command:

```matlab
>> NTCviewer
```

Once initiated, you will have access to a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive data analysis. The GUI is designed to streamline the process of data exploration, manipulation, and visualization.

Here's a glimpse of what you can expect from the NTC viewer interface:
