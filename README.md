# 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the Neutron TimeCube (NTC) analysis tools repository! This project is designed to provide researchers and data analysts with tools to interpret and visualize data from the NTC, a sophisticated device used in neutron detection and characterization.

## 📜 Description

The repository available at [ultralytics/ntc](https://github.com/ultralytics/ntc) houses a suite of MATLAB scripts and functions tailored for the analysis of neutron detection data. With these tools, users can process, analyze, and visualize NTC data, facilitating cutting-edge research in neutron science.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before diving in, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or higher.
- Access to the 'functions-matlab' common functions repository:
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
  ```
  Add the repository to the MATLAB path using:
  ```matlab
  >> addpath(genpath('/path/to/functions-matlab'))
  ```
- The following MATLAB toolboxes should be installed:
  - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
  - Signal Processing Toolbox
  
Ensure that all installations and configurations match these requirements to smoothly run the NTC analysis tools.

## 🏃 Running the Tools

To begin analyzing your data:

1. Open MATLAB
2. Execute the command:
   ```matlab
   >> NTCviewer
   ```
   
Here is a glimpse of the kind of interface you can expect with our `NTCviewer`:

A few notes on the changes:

- The "Introduction" section now includes a welcoming statement that introduces the user to the repository and its purpose.
- I added emojis to the section headers to provide a friendly and visual break in the content.
- In the "Description" section, I provided a bit more detail about what the repository contains and its application.
- The "Requirements" section is expanded for clarity. A bash command is provided to clone the 'functions-matlab' repo, and explicit instructions are given to add the repo to the MATLAB path.
- The "Running" section now has instructions formatted as ordered steps to make them clearer and more accessible.
- I updated the "Contact" section to align with the no email policy, directing users to the existing Ultralytics Support Page.
- Throughout the document, the tone is kept friendly yet professional, with an emphasis on guiding the user through setting up and running the tools.
- Consistent header sizes and markdown conventions are now applied.
